# mitoRiskscore

# Introduction
Due to high energy and material metabolism requirements, mitochondria are frequently active in tumor cells. Our study found that the high energy metabolism status is positively correlated with the poor prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. We constructed a scoring system (mitoRiskscore) based on the gene expression of specific mitochondrial localized proteins through univariate and lasso cox regression. Patients with high mitoRiskscore tend to have a shorter survival time after surgery. Compared with the typical TNM grading system, the mitoRiskscore gene panel had higher prediction accuracy. A large number of external verification results ensured its universality. Additionally, the mitoRiskscore could evaluate the metabolic pattern and chemotherapy sensitivity of the tumor samples. Lung adenocarcinoma with higher mitoRiskscore were more active in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, and the expression of proliferation-related pathway genes were also significantly up-regulated. In contrast, patients with low mitoRiskscore had similar metabolic patterns to normal tissues. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction ability and promote clinical usage, we developed a nomogram that combined mitoRiskscore and clinical prognostic factors to predict the 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rate of patients. We also performed in vitro experiments to verify the function of the key genes in mitoRiskscore panel. In conclusion, the mitoRiskscore scoring system may assist clinicians judge the postoperative survival rate and chemotherapy of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
